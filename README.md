<b>This project is still under active research and development. ⚗️</b>

This project is aiming for:
- **API**: Setup an API gateway to retrieve end of day data, and resampling the time serires data into 
shorter period.

- **Accuracy**: The test scores for each model should be > 90% under cross validation.

- **Automated Trading Strategy**: Design a machine learning 
approach to decide trading strategy.
